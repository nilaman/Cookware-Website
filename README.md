Cookware website

11/15/24

Created a website looking like the figma.  I built it in 1920x1080.  I did normal laptop responsiveness at 1024px, tablet at 768px, and mobile at 576px.  I tried my best with time management and 
tried to replicate it as best as possible. I also had a lot of help from andrie so props to him.

Peer Review: Alan Batres: The Website looked really good in my opinion the desktop looked good but there is some things to change like the text fonts and sizes. The webiste isn't too responsive besides the mobile size but it isn't exact to the protoype that was designed.

Based off what alan said , I added better margin space in the mobile and I made the cards stacks on top of eachother.
