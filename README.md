Cookware website

11/15/24

Created a website looking like the figma.  I built it in 1920x1080.  I did normal laptop responsiveness at 1024px, tablet at 768px, and mobile at 576px.  I tried my best with time management and 
tried to replicate it as best as possible. I also had a lot of help from andrie so props to him.
